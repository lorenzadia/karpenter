# Placement Group Configuration

## Goals
* Allowing a user to configure EC2 Placement Group strategies from an `EC2NodeClass` resource
* Allow the Placement Group strategies to be developed independently from one another

## Background
At present, there is no way to configure an [EC2 Placement Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) with Karpenter. The addition of this feature will expose an important feature of EC2 to Karpenter users, expanding the set of use-cases the tool is appropriate for.

## Proposed Design
To enable the configuration of EC2 Placement Groups with Karpenter, I propose the addition of a `.spec.placementStrategy` value in the `karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1/EC2NodeClass` resource. This new value will have three child fields --  `cluster`, `partition`, and `spread` -- only one of which can be enabled for a given `EC2NodeClass` instance, which is in line with the EC2 API. 

Given the simple and self-contained nature of EC2 Placement Group configurations, my sense is that it makes litle sense to enable the import of preexisting Placement Group configurations. This would add implementation complexity without actually enabling additional features for the user. Karpenter should instead completely manage the lifecycle of EC2 Placement Group resources, tying their lifetimes to the lifetime of the `.spec.placementStrategy` value in the supervising EC2NodeClass resource.


The following YAML snippets depict how this would look in practice, including one case where the `EC2NodeClass` resource *should* be rejected by the Karpenter server.

```yaml

# The following should be rejected by Karpenter, as it enables both 
# the 'partition' and 'cluster' strategies.
